- R & Python for environmental data science
- R Markdown & Jupyter Notebooks
- Workflow pieces (e.g. R Projects, here, .Rmd)

## Day 1 lecture slides:

- Day 1 (morning lecture)
- Day 1 (afternoon lecture)

## Day 1 lab materials:

- Day 1 (morning lab)
- Day 1 (afternoon lab)

## Flex sessions

- Morning flex: Add a blog to your website
- Afternoon flex: Git branches for solo & collaborative work

## Activities:

- A full code-free workflow
- Save this workflow (a coworker has emailed you their .Rmd and the data they've used to create an HTML - also attached). Help them out by making this project reproducible, identifying key places where the workflow breaks down or can be improved (assuming they know git / GitHub).
