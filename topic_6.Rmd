## Linking to internal parts of your site

Sometimes you'll want to have a link to another page *in your website*. How? Use the format `[text](link_to_this_page.html)`. 

For example, if I want to link here to the Resources page, within my .Rmd that looks like this: 

      Find more resources [here](resources.html). 

Which, when built, looks like this: 

Find more resources [here](resources.html).

## External links

Same thing, just add the full URL within the parentheses. For example, to link to UCSB's home page that would look like: 

      Learn more about [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/).
      
Which when built looks like this: 

Learn more about [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/).
