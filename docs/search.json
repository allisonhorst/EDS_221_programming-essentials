      "contents": "\n\nContents\nOverview\nExamples\nof behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment\ninclude:\nExamples\nof unacceptable behavior by class participants include:\nOther resources at UCSB\n\nAll enrolled students, auditors, and course visitors are expected to\ncomply with the following code of conduct. We expect cooperation from\nall members to help ensure a safe and welcoming environment for\neverybody.\nOverview\nWe are determined to make our courses welcoming, inclusive and\nharassment-free for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and\nexpression, race, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical\nappearance, body size, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate\nharassment of class participants, teaching assistants, or instructors in\nany form. Derogatory, abusive, demeaning or sexual language and imagery\nis not appropriate or acceptable. Saying something “as a joke” does not\nmake it less offensive, harmful, or consequential.\nAnything not covered here but that exists in the UCSB\nStudent Conduct Code also applies, and will be enforced by UCSB\nPolicy.\nThese expectations and consequences apply to synchronous discussions,\noffice hours, the course Slack workspace, and all other modes of\ncommunication, posting or discussion by course participants.\nExamples\nof behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment\ninclude:\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\nBeing an aware and respectful colleague (raise your hand when asked,\nrespect others’ time and space, include peers in small discussions,\ndon’t dominate meetings, etc.)\nGiving proper credit to the creator (of an\nidea/material/solution/etc.)\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\nShowing empathy towards all community members\nUnderstanding that an individual’s experience and worldview are\ninfluenced by multiple (and often compounding) facets of their identity,\nand that your perception of a situation/topic/reaction may be very\ndifferent from your classmates’\nExamples\nof unacceptable behavior by class participants include:\nDistracting other students in classes in labs, or otherwise\ndistracting from their education\nAny abuse, disrespect or harassment of teaching assistants, other\nstudents, or teachers, is not tolerated and will result in disciplinary\naction as needed\nThe use of unwelcome sexual attention or advances\nTrolling, insulting/derogatory comments or language, and personal or\npolitical attacks\nPublic or private harassment\nPublishing others’ private information, such as a physical or\nelectronic address, without explicit permission\nOther conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in\na professional setting\nMembers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply\nimmediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is\nbeing harassed, or have any other concerns in or related to these\nclasses, you are welcome to contact Allison or use outside\nresources.\nOther resources at UCSB\nAt Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (CARE) you can chat with\na UCSB staff member in a confidential setting. CARE assists faculty,\nstaff and students who have been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual\nassault, domestic/dating violence, and stalking. The office is\nconfidential so you can talk with a staff member in private without any\nreporting obligations.\nPhone: (805) 893-4613.\nOffice is located in the Student Resource Building (SRB) near\nparking lot 23.\nAnother confidential resource is the Campus Ombuds office. The Ombuds\noffice is particularly helpful if you would like to describe a sensitive\nissue in a confidential setting and learn more about campus resources to\naddress the issue. The Ombuds office is located at 1205-K Girvetz Hall\nand their phone number is 805-893-3285. The Ombuds office provides\nconsultation, mediation, and facilitation, among other services, for\nfaculty, staff and students.\nUCSB Academic Counseling is a resource outside of the Bren department\nthat can help with a number of topics from academic planning to\n“balancing personal difficulties in academics.”\nGraduate counselor: Ryan Sims\nPhone: 805-893-2068\nEmail: ryan.sims@graddiv.ucsb.edu\nThis is a living document, that we are always hoping to improve. If\nyou have suggestions, questions or ideas for how we can update our Code\nof Conduct, we encourage you to reach out to us and will be grateful for\nyour feedback.\nContributions by:\nAllison Horst\nJessica Couture\n\n\n\n",

Students should\nplan to attend all scheduled sessions. All course requirements will be\ncompleted between 9am and 5pm PST (M - F), i.e. you are not expected to\ndo additional work for EDS 221 outside of those hours, unless you are\nworking with the Teaching Assistant in student hours.\n\nNote: For EDS 212 and 221, we will start\nWednesdays at 10:00am.\n\nTentative daily schedule (subject to change):\nTime (PST)\nActivity\n9:00am - 10:00am\nLecture 1\n10:00am - 11:00am\nInteractive Session 1\n11:00am - 12:00pm\nFlex time\n12:00pm - 1:15pm\nLunch\n1:15pm - 2:15pm\nLecture 2\n2:15pm - 3:15pm\nInteractive Session 2\n3:15pm - 5:00pm\nGroup & individual tasks\nExpected sessions (subject\nto change)\nNote: lectures and flex sessions will also often\ninclude interactive live-coding.
