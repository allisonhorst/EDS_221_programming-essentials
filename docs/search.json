      "contents": "\n\nContents\nOverview\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by class participants include:\nOther resources at UCSB\n\nAll enrolled students, auditors, and course visitors are expected to comply with the following code of conduct. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everybody.\nOverview\nWe are determined to make our courses welcoming, inclusive and harassment-free for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, race, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of class participants, teaching assistants, or instructors in any form. Derogatory, abusive, demeaning or sexual language and imagery is not appropriate or acceptable. Saying something “as a joke” does not make it less offensive, harmful, or consequential.\nAnything not covered here but that exists in the UCSB Student Conduct Code also applies, and will be enforced by UCSB Policy.\nThese expectations and consequences apply to synchronous discussions, office hours, the course Slack workspace, and all other modes of communication, posting or discussion by course participants.\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\nBeing an aware and respectful colleague (raise your hand when asked, respect others’ time and space, include peers in small discussions, don’t dominate meetings, etc.)\nGiving proper credit to the creator (of an idea/material/solution/etc.)\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\nShowing empathy towards all community members\nUnderstanding that an individual’s experience and worldview are influenced by multiple (and often compounding) facets of their identity, and that your perception of a situation/topic/reaction may be very different from your classmates’\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by class participants include:\nDistracting other students in classes in labs, or otherwise distracting from their education\nAny abuse, disrespect or harassment of teaching assistants, other students, or teachers, is not tolerated and will result in disciplinary action as needed\nThe use of unwelcome sexual attention or advances\nTrolling, insulting/derogatory comments or language, and personal or political attacks\nPublic or private harassment\nPublishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\nOther conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\nMembers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns in or related to these classes, you are welcome to contact Allison or use outside resources.\nOther resources at UCSB\nAt Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (CARE) you can chat with a UCSB staff member in a confidential setting. CARE assists faculty, staff and students who have been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, and stalking. The office is confidential so you can talk with a staff member in private without any reporting obligations.\nPhone: (805) 893-4613.\nOffice is located in the Student Resource Building (SRB) near parking lot 23.\nAnother confidential resource is the Campus Ombuds office. The Ombuds office is particularly helpful if you would like to describe a sensitive issue in a confidential setting and learn more about campus resources to address the issue. The Ombuds office is located at 1205-K Girvetz Hall and their phone number is 805-893-3285. The Ombuds office provides consultation, mediation, and facilitation, among other services, for faculty, staff and students.\nUCSB Academic Counseling is a resource outside of the Bren department that can help with a number of topics from academic planning to “balancing personal difficulties in academics.”\nGraduate counselor: Ryan Sims\nPhone: 805-893-2068\nEmail: ryan.sims@graddiv.ucsb.edu\nThis is a living document, that we are always hoping to improve. If you have suggestions, questions or ideas for how we can update our Code of Conduct, we encourage you to reach out to us and will be grateful for your feedback.\nContributions by:\nAllison Horst\nJessica Couture\n\n\n\n",

Topics include structured programming and algorithm development, iteration, conditionals, functions and objects, documentation, testing and troubleshooting, tidy data structure, and an introduction to data wrangling and visualization. The course will be taught in R and Python.\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of EDS 221, students should be able to:\nUnderstand, create, and work with different data structures (e.g. vectors, data frames, lists) and types (e.g. numeric, character, factor, logical, date-times)\nDesign, implement, test and document functions (including functions with iteration, conditionals, messages and warnings) in R and Python\nUse basic (non-collaborative) project-oriented workflows with reproducible code (R scripts, R Markdown, and Jupyter Notebooks) and version control (git/GitHub basics)\nPerform basic data wrangling and visualization with real world environmental data with tidyverse packages (in R) and pandas/seaborn (in Python)\nEmploy troubleshooting and debugging strategies (tools, mindsets, strategies, resources)\nPredictable daily schedule\nCourse dates: Monday (2021-08-09) - Friday (2021-08-20)\nEDS 221 is an intensive 2-week long 4-unit course. Students should plan to attend all scheduled sessions. All course requirements will be completed between 8am and 5pm PST (M - F), i.e. you are not expected to do additional work for EDS 221 outside of those hours, unless you are working with the Teaching Assistant in student hours.\n\nNote: For EDS 212 and 221, we will start Wednesdays at 10:00am (instead of 8:00am).\n\nTentative daily schedule (subject to change):\nTime (PST)\nActivity\n9:00am - 10:00am\nLecture 1 (60 min)\n10:00am - 11:00am\nInteractive Session 1 (60 min)\n11:00am - 11:10am\nBreak (10 min)\n11:10am - 12:00pm\nFlex time (50 min)\n12:00pm - 1:15pm\nLunch (75 min)\n1:15pm - 2:15pm\nLecture 2 (60 min)\n2:15pm - 3:15pm\nInteractive Session 2 (45 min)\n3:15pm - 5:00pm\nGroup & individual tasks (90 min)\nExpected sessions (subject to change)\nNote: lectures and flex sessions will also often include interactive live-coding.
