We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everybody.\nOverview\nWe are determined to make our courses welcoming, inclusive and harassment-free for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, race, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of class participants, teaching assistants, or instructors in any form. Derogatory, abusive, demeaning or sexual language and imagery is not appropriate or acceptable. Saying something “as a joke” does not make it less offensive, harmful, or consequential.\nAnything not covered here but that exists in the UCSB Student Conduct Code also applies, and will be enforced by UCSB Policy.\nThese expectations and consequences apply to synchronous discussions, office hours, the course Slack workspace, and all other modes of communication, posting or discussion by course participants.\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\nBeing an aware and respectful colleague (raise your hand when asked, respect others’ time and space, include peers in small discussions, don’t dominate meetings, etc.)\nGiving proper credit to the creator (of an idea/material/solution/etc.)\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\nShowing empathy towards all community members\nUnderstanding that an individual’s experience and worldview are influenced by multiple (and often compounding) facets of their identity, and that your perception of a situation/topic/reaction may be very different from your classmates’\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by class participants include:\nDistracting other students in classes in labs, or otherwise distracting from their education\nAny abuse, disrespect or harassment of teaching assistants, other students, or teachers, is not tolerated and will result in disciplinary action as needed\nThe use of unwelcome sexual attention or advances\nTrolling, insulting/derogatory comments or language, and personal or political attacks\nPublic or private harassment\nPublishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\nOther conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\nMembers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns in or related to these classes, you are welcome to contact Allison or use outside resources.\nOther resources at UCSB\nAt Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (CARE) you can chat with a UCSB staff member in a confidential setting. CARE assists faculty, staff and students who have been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, and stalking. The office is confidential so you can talk with a staff member in private without any reporting obligations.\nPhone: (805) 893-4613.\nOffice is located in the Student Resource Building (SRB) near parking lot 23.\nAnother confidential resource is the Campus Ombuds office. The Ombuds office is particularly helpful if you would like to describe a sensitive issue in a confidential setting and learn more about campus resources to address the issue. The Ombuds office is located at 1205-K Girvetz Hall and their phone number is 805-893-3285. The Ombuds office provides consultation, mediation, and facilitation, among other services, for faculty, staff and students.\nUCSB Academic Counseling is a resource outside of the Bren department that can help with a number of topics from academic planning to “balancing personal difficulties in academics.”\nGraduate counselor: Ryan Sims\nPhone: 805-893-2068\nEmail: ryan.sims@graddiv.ucsb.edu\nThis is a living document, that we are always hoping to improve. If you have suggestions, questions or ideas for how we can update our Code of Conduct, we encourage you to reach out to us and will be grateful for your feedback.\nContributions by:\nAllison Horst\nJessica Couture\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\nContents\nAdd a site page\nThe quick version:\nMake each page an R Markdown document\nAdd it to your navigation bar\n\nDelete/disappear a site page\n\nNOTE: There are 10 toy Topic sections here, expecting that some teachers may want to have one page per week (for a 10 week course). You are encouraged to structure your course however works best for your class. All of your course information could be on a single page, or you might have a different number of topics, or organize weekly, or any other organization that works for you.\n\nTO UPDATE THIS PAGE: Open and edit the topic_1.Rmd file, in the project root, to delete this placeholder text and customize with your own!\n\nAdd a site page\nThe quick version:\nMake a new R Markdown document, save\nAdd the rendered .html to _site.yaml so the page exists on the site\nBuild to see updated site\nBelow for a bit more detail…\nMake each page an R Markdown document\nTo make a new page:\nWithin your website Project, create a new .Rmd (File > New File > R Markdown). Save it to the project root. For this example, let’s say you’ve saved it as new_page.Rmd.\nIn that .Rmd file, remove everything but the title (which you can change) from the YAML - that’s the top section of the .Rmd, where by default it has title, author, date, etc.\nUpdate the .Rmd to contain whatever you want to have on that page. Don’t know a lot about markdown? Considering switching over to the Visual Editor in RStudio (versions >= 1.4).\nSave the .Rmd\nAdd it to your navigation bar\nOpen the _site.yml file in your Project\nAdd the information to the YAML navbar section, which will almost always be the text that you want to appear in the navigation bar, and the file name of the knitted html that will be automatically rendered to /docs when you Build your website. That would be new_page.html for this example (since the .Rmd it is rendered from is new_page.Rmd). So in the _site.yml I would need to add this to the navbar section:\n    - text: \"A new page!\"\n      href: new_page.html\nNote: YAML is space & indentation specific. Follow the structure that already exists in this template to avoid YAML errors.\nHow is the website finding the html? Notice in the _site.yml file, the output_dir is set to docs. That means when we press ‘Build website’ (in the Build tab in RStudio), our .Rmd pages are knitted to HTML & sent to the _docs folder. This is also important because when we deploy the site (make it live), we will want to deploy from that docs folder using GitHub pages.\nTake a look at some other pages in this template (Resources, Assignments, etc.) to see the structure, & give it a shot!\nDelete/disappear a site page\nThe safest thing to do if you don’t want a page to show up is to remove it from the _site.yml navbar listings. That way, the material on the page still exists as a file in your project, but doesn’t show up on the website – don’t delete a page file unless you are REALLY SURE that you’re never going to want the material on that page ever again.\n\n\n\n",
