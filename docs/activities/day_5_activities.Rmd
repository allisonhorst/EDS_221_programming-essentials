## Setup

- Create a new repo on GitHub called `eds221-day5-activities`
- Clone to create a version-controlled R Project
- Create subfolders: `docs`, `src`, `data`, `figs`

## Task 1: Make a function, source in an R Markdown doc

**Citation:** [NCDENR Stormwater BMP Manual](https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/Water%20Quality/Surface%20Water%20Protection/SPU/SPU%20-%20BMP%20Manual%20Documents/BMPMan-Ch03-SWCalcs-20090616-DWQ-SPU.pdf)

One established way to calculate the volume of stormwater expected for a watershed (necessary to design best management practices & systems) is the *Simple Method*, which involves two steps. First, the runoff coefficient $R_v$ (storm runoff / storm rainfall) is calculated from: $$R_v = 0.05 + 0.9 * I_A$$ 

Where $R_v$ is the runoff coefficient (unitless), and $I_A$ is the fraction of the watershed that is considered "impervious" (unitless). 
The volume of stormwater that needs to be handled, $V$ in cubic feet, is then calculated by: $$V=3630 * R_D * R_v * A$$
where $R_D$ is the "*design storm rainfall depth*" in inches, usually set to 1.0 or 1.5, $R_v$ is the runoff coefficient calculated above, and $A$ is the watershed area in acres. 

**YOUR TASK:**

- Create a new R script in `src`, saved as `storm_runoff.R`

- In the script, create a function called `predict_runoff` that estimates the storm runoff volume using inputs for the impervious fraction and watershed area (you can use a constant value of 1 for $R_D$ here). In other words, your function should only require two arguments

- Add documentation to your function using `Roxygen` comments for practice

- Try out your function in the Console to ensure that it works

```{r, include = FALSE}
predict_runoff <- function(frac_impervious, watershed_area) {

  # if (frac_impervious <= 0 | frac_impervious >= 1) {
  #   stop("Must be between 0 and 1")
  # }
  
  ifelse(frac_impervious <= 1, TRUE, stop("NOPE"))
  
  runoff_coef <- 0.05 + 0.9 * frac_impervious
  runoff_volume <- 3630 * 1.0 * {runoff_coef} * watershed_area
  print(runoff_volume)
}

predict_runoff(frac_impervious = 0.9, watershed_area = 5.2)

predict_runoff(frac_impervious = c(0.3, 0.8, 0.6), watershed_area = 5.2)
```

- Create a new R Markdown document in `docs`, saved as `runoff_volumes.Rmd`

- Attach the `tidyverse` and `here` packages

- Source your `storm_runoff.R` script so you are able to use the `predict_runoff` function in your .Rmd

- In a code chunk in your `runoff_volumes.Rmd`, use your `predict_runoff` function to estimate stormwater volume for a watershed of 182 acres, over a range of estimates for the impervious fraction (from 0.6 to 0.8, by increments of 0.01). *Note: you do not need to write a for loop here.* 

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Make the sequence of impervious fractions
impervious_sequence <- seq(from = 0.6, to = 0.8, by = 0.01)

# Make predictions for volume at all values of impervious fraction, for watershed area = 182
val <-predict_runoff(frac_impervious = impervious_sequence, watershed_area = 182)
val
```

- Bind your sequence of impervious fractions together with the resulting runoff volume calculated into a data frame

- Create a ggplot graph that has both dots and connecting lines (i.e., you'll layer `geom_point()` and `geom_line()`. Update axis labels. Export a png of your graph to the `figs` folder using `ggsave`. 

```{r, include = FALSE}

runoff_df <- data.frame(impervious_sequence, val)

ggplot(data = runoff_df, aes(x = impervious_sequence, y = val)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Fraction impervious surface in the watershed",
       y = "Expected runoff volume (cubic feet)")

```

*Done with Task 1*

## Task 2: Wild data

For Task 2, you will work with the `us_tilapia_imports.csv`. It exists in your `eds221-day5-comp` project - copy that file into your `data` folder for your day 5 activities project. The data are from the USDA Economic Research Service, and contain annual total volumes (in thousands of pounds) of tilapia imports to the United States from different countries. 

**You can decide if you want to do this all in separate steps, or piped together in sequence, or some combination.** Make sure if you pipe things together, you check the output at every step.  

- Create a new .Rmd in your `docs` folder called `us_tilapia_imports.Rmd`

- Attach the `tidyverse`, `here` and `janitor` packages

- Read in the data as `us_tilapia_imports` 

- Explore the data. What are the classes of the columns? Remember some tools we've used: `summary`, `names`, `dim`, `skim`, etc.

- Use `pivot_longer()` to reshape the data into long format (currently, the variable "year" is spread across multiple columns). Remember to store the output so you will be able to use the reshaped data this creates.

- Check the class of the `year` column. What is it, and why do you think that's the case? Then, coerce the year column to `numeric` (e.g. using `mutate()` and `as.numeric()` in combination)

- Use `dplyr::group_by() %>% summarize()` to find the *total* US tilapia imports by *year*, store as `yearly_tilapia_tot`

```{r, include = FALSE}
us_tilapia_imports <- read_csv(here::here("activities", "us_tilapia_imports.csv")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = '1992':'2018', names_to = 'year', values_to = 'tilapia_volume_kpounds') %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

yearly_tilapia_tot <- us_tilapia_imports %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(annual_total = sum(tilapia_volume_kpounds, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Create a ggplot line graph of total US tilapia imports for all years in `yearly_tilapia_tot`. Update axis labels (include units as necessary), then export your graph as a .png to `figs`.

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = yearly_tilapia_tot, aes(x = year, y = annual_total)) +
  geom_line()
```

- Create a subset that only retains imports from Ecuador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Mexico (you decide what to name this)

- Create a ggplot graph of total US tilapia imports over time, for those four countries in the subset you created above, separated by country. Update axis labels, add a title, customize your color scheme, update the theme. Export a .jpg of your graph to `figs`.

```{r, include = FALSE}
 limited_us_tilapia <- us_tilapia_imports %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Ecuador", "Honduras", "Costa Rica", "Mexico"))

ggplot(data = limited_us_tilapia, aes(x = year, y = tilapia_volume_kpounds)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country))
```

**Done with Task 2.**

## Task 3: Add to your R package

For Task 3, reopen your R package you started today, and add two new functions. They can do whatever you want as long as: 

- They have at least two required arguments
- You add documentation for each function with a Roxygen skeleton

Once you've added your functions, make sure to `devtools::document()`, Install and Restart, and check to make sure your functions are working, and that you can see your documentation. Then: 

- Push your changes back to your repo on GitHub
- Share the link with someone (they'll need to reinstall your package from GitHub using `install_github("username/reponame")`)

## END Day 5 activities
