## Setup: 

- Partner up, then decide who is Partner 1 & who is Partner 2 for this activity
- **You should be working together on all of this activity, even though it is split up into "Partner 1" and "Partner 2" sections**

### Partner 1:

- Create a new version-controlled R Project named `fiddler-crab-sizes`
- In a new Quarto document, attach the `lterdatasampler` package
- Read through the documentation for the `pie_crab` data sample, and spend ~5 minutes talking with your partner about the data contains, the shape, variables, and why it was collected. See more information and examples with the data [here](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/articles/pie_crab_vignette.html).
- Save your document
- Push your changes back to GitHub (you don't need to work in a branch for this step -- push straight to `main`)
- Add your partner as a collaborator to the repo

```{r, include = FALSE}
fiddler_crab <- read_csv(here("activities", "fiddler_crab.csv"))
```

### Partner 2: 

- Accept the invitation to collaborate (check your email) & clone the repo
- Create a NEW BRANCH to work in
- In the Quarto doc, create an exploratory (unfinalized) plot of fiddler crab carapace widths observed at the different latitudes
- Push your updates
- Submit a Pull Request through GitHub

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = fiddler_crab) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Latitude, x = carapace_width))
```

### Partner 1: 

- Merge in the Pull Request
- Pull changes into `main`
- Switch over into a NEW BRANCH
- **Finalize the figure**. Add a figure caption using `#| fig-cap: "this is my caption"` in the code chunk where the graph is created. Update code chunk options (hint: `execute: ` in YAML) so that only your finalized graph and figure caption show up in your knitted report (i.e., no code should show up)
- To your document, add an unfinalized summary table containing the mean, standard deviation, and sample size of fiddler crab carapace widths by site (tip: use `round(mean(), 2)` to round a value to 2 decimal places)
- Push your changes
- Submit a Pull Request in GitHub

```{r, include = FALSE}
fiddler_summary <- fiddler_crab %>% 
  drop_na(carapace_width) %>% 
  group_by(Site) %>% 
  summarize(mean_carapace = round(mean(carapace_width), 2),
            sd_carapace = round(sd(carapace_width), 2),
            n = n()) 

fiddler_summary %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Site code", "Mean carapace width (mm)", "Standard deviation (mm)", "Sample size")) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

### Partner 2: 

- Merge in the Pull Request
- Go back to your `main` branch locally, and pull down changes
- Create and checkout a NEW BRANCH
- **Finalize the summary table** a bit so that it looks more polished when rendered, including with updated column names (including units as relevant). 
- Push your updates, submit a PR on GitHub

### Partner 1: 

- Merge in the PR
- Switch over to your `main` branch locally, pull in changes
- Create and checkout a NEW BRANCH
- Work with your partner to write a short introduction to the figures in your knitted document (e.g. so that if it were shared as a short blog post, someone would understand what they were looking at)
- Add any necessary citations for the data at the end of the document
- Push your changes and submit a PR on GitHub

### Partner 2: 

- Merge in the PR

### Both partners:

- Move back over into your `main` local branch
- Pull down changes

## Done with morning task

```{r, include = FALSE}
meansize_airtemp <- fiddler_crab %>% 
  group_by(Latitude) %>% 
  summarize(mean_size = mean(carapace_width),
            mean_water = mean(MATW))

ggplot(data = meansize_airtemp, aes(x = mean_water, y = mean_size)) +
  geom_point()
```
