<p style="color: #ba5e00"><b>TO UPDATE THIS PAGE:</b> Open and edit the <b>topic_4.Rmd</b> file, in the project root, to delete this placeholder text and customize with your own!</p>

The bells and whistles of this MEDS template (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) are customized in the `theme.css` file in your Project root. 

If you love css or want to make changes, you're encouraged to customize your site! There is minor annotation in the css file, but honestly this will probably just take quite a bit of Inspect Element to figure out what to change. 

**Fonts:** If you specifically want to know how to change the site fonts, see [here](module_9.html).
