Dataset Abstract

	Our central objective is to use small, neighborhood parks in Phoenix to study: (1)
                the ways in which ecological processes are influenced by human values, use, and
                management; and (2) the ways in which human attitudes and activities, and the
                services valued by humans, are influenced by ecological characteristics and
                processes. Elucidating this coupling in Phoenix parks will itself be a significant
                step towards understanding the complexities of human-nature interactions. The
                information gathered in addressing the central objective, though, can and should be
                used to assess potential trajectories for ecological processes. Our second objective
                is to develop trajectories for potential changes in ecosystem services in the
                Phoenix metropolitan area, given economic and demographic trends, and given the
                signal of human-nature interactions among different social groups.
