One of the first things you'll want to do is update your site title, subtitle, and the short link on the right side of the navbar. 

Here's how:

- The main title and subtitle for the home page live in the YAML of the `index.Rmd` file. Open it in your project, update the `title` and `description` fields in the YAML, save, then build your site (In RStudio: Build > Build Website) to see the updated title.

- The label for the short link in the upper right of the page (right side of the navigation bar) is specified in the `_site.yml` page. Open the `_site.yml` file in your project, update the Title field, save, and rebuild the site to see your update.
