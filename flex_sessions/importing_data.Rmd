title: 'Flex session: reading in data'
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The goal of this flex session is to read in several different common data types in R and Python, and to identify similarities across the methods & languages. 

We will learn/refresh how to import data from: 

- Comma separated value (.csv) files
- Excel (.xls, .xlsx) files
- Text (.txt) files
- Googlesheets (?)
- Shapefiles (.shp)
- Data from a URL

## 1. Data from a CSV


```{r}

```
