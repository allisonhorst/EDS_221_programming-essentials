## Where should I save my images?

Drop images you want to include on your site into the existing `img` folder within your R Project (or make your own folder for images, set up a subfolder structure, etc.) - as long as you can easily point to them within your project. 

## How do I make images show up on my site? 

There are a bunch of ways to add images in an R Markdown document (see more examples from the R Markdown Cookbook [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figure-size.html)). 

I recommend using `knitr::include_graphics("path_to_image")`. 

For example, if there is an image saved as `cool_dogs.jpg` in the `img` folder, then you can add this to your R Markdown document by adding (within a code chunk): 

````md

```{r, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
  knitr::include_graphics("img/cool_dogs.jpg")
```

````

You can also update the size of the image, add a caption, etc. by updating the code chunk header, e.g.:

````md

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Some cool dogs!"}`r ''`
  knitr::include_graphics("img/cool_dogs.jpg")
```

````

For example, the image `usgs_sat.jpeg` is in the `img` folder of this template. I can have it show up here by include a code chunk that looks like this: 

````md

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "USGS image of Mississippi River."}`r ''`
  knitr::include_graphics("img/usgs_sat.jpeg")
```

````

Which creates: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "USGS image of Mississippi River."}

knitr::include_graphics("img/usgs_sat.jpeg")

```
