## Welcome to the MEDS distill template

Welcome to the MEDS Course Website template! This template is made with [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), a package to build lightweight and robust websites in R. This method for creating a course website may make the most sense for MEDS teachers who are familiar with RStudio, R Markdown, git and GitHub (or who want to learn!). For those of you who do *not* want to create your website with distill in R, but still want a course website, check out [Course-in-a-Box](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/) to create a site with no prior coding experience.

For those wanting to take the distill/R websites path: this template acts as both a starting point for your site, and place to learn basics ways to customize it (different topics currently populate the different modules, which I expect teachers will replace with different weeks or lessons or topics as useful for your courses). 

### Some starting points:

- Follow along with the "Getting started with the MEDS distill template" (COMING SOON) instructions to set up your own distill website. Please reach out to Allison for help getting your website started, and submit problems and suggestions as issues [here](https://github.com/allisonhorst/meds-distill-template). 

- The "Weekly materials" section of this template site can be updated with your course materials, but also in this template serves the additional purpose of showing you how to customize some things on your page.

- See the [EDS 212 Website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/EDS_212_essential-math/) for an example of what a customized live course site can look like using this template.
