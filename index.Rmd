## Course description

In EDS 221, students will build key scientific programming skills essential for environmental data analysis and problem solving. Topics include structured programming and algorithm development, iteration, conditionals, functions and objects, documentation, testing and troubleshooting, tidy data structure, and an introduction to data wrangling and visualization. The course will be taught in R and Python.

## Predictable daily schedule

**Course dates:** Monday (2021-08-09) - Friday (2021-08-20)

EDS 221 is an intensive 2-week long 4-unit course. Students should plan to attend all scheduled sessions. All course requirements will be completed between 8am and 5pm PST (M - F), i.e. you are not expected to do additional work for EDS 221 outside of those hours, unless you are working with the Teaching Assistant in student hours.

Tentative daily schedule (subject to change):

|                   |                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Time (PST)**    | **Activity**                                               |
| 8:00am - 9:00am   | *Lecture 1 (60 min)*                                       |
| 9:00am - 9:15am   | *Break 1 (15 min)*                                         |
| 9:15am - 10:15am  | *Interactive Session 1 (60 min)*                           |
| 10:15am - 11:00am | *Flex time (45 min)*                                       |
| 11:00am - 12:15pm | *Break 2 (75 min)*                                         |
| 12:15pm - 1:15pm  | *Lecture 2 (60 min)*                                       |
| 1:15pm - 2:15pm   | *Interactive Session 2 (60 min)*                           |
| 2:15pm - 3:15pm   | *Flex time (60 min)*                                       |
| 3:15pm - 5:00pm   | *Interactive Session 3: Group & challenge tasks (105 min)* |

## Learning objectives

By the end of EDS 221, students should be able to:

-   **Design, implement, test and document algorithms** in R and Python (including functions with iteration, conditionals, messages and warnings)

-   **Understand, create, convert, and work with different data structures** (e.g. vectors, data frames, lists) **and types** (e.g. numeric, character, factor, logical, datetimes)

-   **Perform basic data wrangling and visualization** with real world environmental data with tidyverse (in R) and pandas/seaborn (in Python)

-   **Employ troubleshooting and debugging strategies** (tools, mindsets, strategies, resources)

-   **Use basic (non-collaborative) project-oriented workflows** with reproducible code (R scripts, R Markdown, Python scripts) and version control (git/GitHub basics)

## Course requirements

### Computing

-   Minimum [MEDS device requirements](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/computer_reqs.html) (bring to all sessions + charger!)

-   R version 4.0.2 (or higher)

-   RStudio version 1.4.1103 (or higher)
