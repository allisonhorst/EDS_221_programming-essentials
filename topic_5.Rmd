If you're familiar with markdown, use standard syntax to update font styles, add bulleted lists, subscripts/superscripts, etc. (or learn more from the [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.org/links/r_markdown_cheat_sheet)). 

If you're not familiar with markdown and want an easier way to update formatting, there is a Visual Editor in RStudio versions > 1.4. It is absolutely worth it to check it out for easier formatting of text, images, tables, citations, and more.
